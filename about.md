I am a final-year student pursuing Computer Science and Engineering from Maharaja Agrasen Institute Of Technology (MAIT). I consider myself a lifelong learner and believe in working hard. My main interests include machine learning and deep learning, particularly in the field of computer vision. <br> <br>

In my undergraduation years at MAIT, I have worked on several research projects with international collaboration under the guidance of Dr. Deepak Gupta. Recently, we presented a paper at ICICC 2021. We proposed a method for domain-controlled title generation using transformer model, and compared the model-generated titles with human-generated titles by performing a human evaluation. We have also published works in Elsevier and IEEE. <br> <br>

I have proven interests in the area of machine learning and deep learning as demonstrated by my work in research. I have a sincere desire to contribute to the ever-increasing knowledge in these areas.
