### Research Papers<a name="papers"></a>

* [**Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, Elsevier 2020**] 

  * **An optimized dense convolutional neural network model for disease recognition and classification in corn leaf**
    
    * **Authors** : Abdul Waheed, **Muskan Goyal**, Deepak Gupta, Ashish Khanna, Aboul Ella Hassanien, Hari Mohan Pandey.
    * **Abstract** : Proposed and implemented an optimised DenseNet model which has been contrasted with the current CNN architectures by considering two (time and accuracy) quality measures. The study indicated that the performance of the optimised DenseNet model was close to that of the established CNN architectures with far fewer parameters and computation time.

* [**IEEE Access 2020**]
  * **CovidGAN: Data Augmentation using Auxiliary Classifier GAN for improved Covid-19 Detection**

  * **Authors** : Abdul Waheed, **Muskan Goyal**, Deepak Gupta, Ashish Khanna, Fadi-Al-Turjman, P. Rogerio Pinheiro.
  * **Abstract** : Proposed and implemented a GAN called CovidGAN that generated synthetic chest X-ray images to enhance the performance of CNN for Covid-19 detection. The research aimed at improved Covid-19 detection and more robust radiology systems.

<!-- ### Datasets<a name="datasets"></a>

* [**IMDB Spoiler Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/imdb-spoiler-dataset) \[**Released**: May 2019\]

  * User-generated reviews are often our first point of contact when we consider watching a movie or a TV show. However, beyond telling us the qualitative aspects about the item we want to consume, reviews may inevitably contain undesired revelatory information (i.e. 'spoilers') such as the surprising fate of a character in a movie, or identity of a murderer in a crime-suspense movie etc. For users who are interested in consuming the item but are unaware of the critical plot twists, spoilers may decrease the excitement regarding the pleasurable uncertainty and curiosity of media consumption. Therefore, a natural question is how to identify these spoilers in entertainment reviews, so that users can more effectively navigate review platforms. This dataset is collected from IMDB and contains meta-data about items as well as user reviews with information regarding whether a review contains a spoiler or not. (**1000+ downloads on Kaggle**)

* [**Clothing Fit Dataset for Size Recommendation**](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/clothing-fit-dataset-for-size-recommendation/home) \[**Released**: August 2018\]

  * Product size recommendation and fit prediction are critical in order to improve customers’ shopping experiences and to reduce product return rates. However, modeling customers’ fit feedback is challenging due to its subtle semantics, arising from the subjective evaluation of products and imbalanced label distribution (most of the feedbacks are "Fit"). These datasets, which are the only fit related datasets available publically at this time, collected from [*ModCloth*](https://www.modcloth.com/) and [*RentTheRunWay*](https://www.renttherunway.com/) could be used to address these challenges to improve the recommendation process.

* [**News Headlines Dataset For Sarcasm Detection**](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection/home) \[**Released**: June 2018\]

  * Past studies in Sarcasm Detection mostly make use of Twitter datasets collected using hashtag based supervision but such datasets are noisy in terms of labels and language. Furthermore, many tweets are replies to other tweets and detecting sarcasm in these requires the availability of contextual tweets. To overcome the limitations related to noise in Twitter datasets, this **News Headlines dataset for Sarcasm Detection** is collected from two news website. [*TheOnion*](https://www.theonion.com/) aims at producing sarcastic versions of current events and we collected all the headlines from News in Brief and News in Photos categories (which are sarcastic). We collect real (and non-sarcastic) news headlines from [*HuffPost*](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/). (**20000+ downloads on Kaggle**)

* [**News Category Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-category-dataset/home) \[**Released**: June 2018\]

  * This dataset contains around 200k news headlines from the year 2012 to 2018 obtained from [*HuffPost*](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/). This dataset could be used to produce some interesting liguistic insights about the type of language used in different news articles or to simply identify tags for untracked news articles.
