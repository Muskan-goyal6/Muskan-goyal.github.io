<summary><b>Undergraduate Researcher, collaborated with professors from Cairo University, Egypt and Edge Hill University, Lancashire, England.</b> [September 2019]</summary>

 
  - Proposed and implemented an optimised DenseNet model which has been contrasted with the current CNN architectures by considering two (time and accuracy) quality measures. The study indicated that the performance of the optimised DenseNet model was close to that of the established CNN architectures with far fewer parameters and computation time. Paper published in Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, Elsevier.
  - Frameworks: Python (TensorFlow and Keras)

<summary><b>Summer Fellow @ Indian Institue of Technology, Madras</b> [May 2014 - July 2014]</summary>

  I was a part of Summer Fellowship Programme of IIT Madras and worked here under the guidance of [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) in the field of Statistical Machine Learning. I did a project on Collaborative Tweet Recommendation where I used Collaborative Filtering to efficiently recommend relevant tweets to users.

## Research Experience<a name="research"></a>

<details>

<summary><b>Student Researcher @ UC San Diego</b> [April 2017 - June 2018]</summary>
 
  Under [Prof. Julian McAuley's](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/) guidance, I worked on several user behavior modeling and NLP problems and published following articles:
  * [WSDM 2020: Addressing Marketing Bias in Product Recommendations](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3336191.3371855)
  * [ACL 2019: Fine-Grained Spoiler Detection from Large-Scale Review Corpora](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1248)
  * [RecSys 2018: Decomposing Fit Semantics for Product Size Recommendation in Metric Spaces](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/pdfs/recsys18e.pdf)

<summary><b>Research Intern @ Indian Institue of Technology, Madras</b> [December 2014 - May 2015]</summary>

  I worked under the guidance of [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) and contributed to two research problems, focusing on the development of scalable Bayesian algorithms for Recommender Systems.
  * Contributed to the development of scalable Bayesian Matrix Factorization algorithm, which reduces the cubic time complexity of existing algorithm to linear. Published in ECML/PKDD 2015 workshop: [Scalable Bayesian Matrix Factorization](https://www.kde.cs.uni-kassel.de/wp-content/uploads/ws/muse2015/papers/saha.pdf)
  * Contributed to the development of scalable variational Bayesian framework for Factorization Machines, which supplements the existing framework with a scalable alternative. Preprint: [Scalable Variational Bayesian Factorization Machine](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rishabh_Misra/publication/320408037_Scalable_Variational_Bayesian_Factorization_Machine/links/59e32a86aca2724cbfe36911/Scalable-Variational-Bayesian-Factorization-Machine.pdf)
