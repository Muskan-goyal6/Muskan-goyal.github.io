<summary><b>Undergraduate Researcher (Minor Project)</b> [Dec 2020]</summary>

 <ul>
  <li> Under <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MpPI1p4AAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Deepak Gupta's</a> guidance, proposed a method for generating domain-controlled titles for scientific papers using text-to-text transformer model.</li>
  <li> Framework: Python (Pytorch) </li>
 </ul>

<summary><b>Undergraduate Researcher, collaborated with professors from Near East University, Mersin, Turkey and State University of Cear√°, Brazil.</b> [March 2020]</summary>

 <ul>
  <li> Proposed and implemented a GAN called CovidGAN that generated synthetic chest X-ray images to enhance the performance of CNN for Covid-19 detection. The research aimed at improved Covid-19 detection and more robust radiology systems. Paper published in IEEE Access. </li>
  <li> Framework: Python (Keras) </li>
 </ul>

<summary><b>Undergraduate Researcher, collaborated with professors from Cairo University, Egypt and Edge Hill University, Lancashire, England.</b> [September 2019]</summary>

 <ul>
  <li> Proposed and implemented an optimised DenseNet model which has been contrasted with the current CNN architectures by considering two (time and accuracy) quality measures. The study indicated that the performance of the optimised DenseNet model was close to that of the established CNN architectures with far fewer parameters and computation time. Paper published in Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, Elsevier.</li>
  <li> Frameworks: Python (TensorFlow and Keras) </li>
 </ul>
